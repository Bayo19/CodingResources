                <p><span class="roob-span">Ruby</span> is a very high-level programming language created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in an effort to emphasize human needs instead of computer needs. A high level language is one that is closer to human languages and further from machine language (ones and zeros).  According to the creator of the language, Ruby was made to make programmers more productive and happy.

Most programming languages have similarities and because Ruby has the most readable syntax for new developers, it's a great language to learn as an introduction to programming as <span class="roob-stein">it helps to understand how other languages work.</span></p>
