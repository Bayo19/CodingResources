 For now the focus is on web developement but the scope of the website will open up and be more varied as I learn more  about coding and programming.
<br><br>
The purpose of this website is to help people, primarily junior developers, by putting all the best web development resources in one place for easy access, especially in case we forget the name of fun tools we have used before.</p>
